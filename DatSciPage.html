        <h3 class="pro-description">Problem:</h3>
        <h3 class="pro-description indented">In our lab, we collected a variety of behavioral data 
          from experimental subjects across four distinct groups. The challenge was that this data 
          requires extensive reformatting before it can be transferred to statistical analysis 
          software for group-by-group testing and graphing. This manual reformatting process was 
          not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error. Moreover, the statistical 
          software used generates basic and aesthetically unappealing graphs, which limits the 
          quality of data visualization.</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
        <h3 class="pro-description indented">To overcome the inefficiencies and error-prone nature 
          of manual data reformatting, a PySimpleGUI desktop application was created, tailored 
          for processing behavioral data from uniformly formatted Excel datasheets. The application 
          boasts a user-friendly graphical interface, enabling lab members to quickly extract 
          relevant data, conduct group-by-group analyses, and generate comparative graphs with 
          minimal effort. This solution allows users to perform these tasks with a few clicks, 
          delivering analyzed results and high-quality visualizations of group differences within 
          seconds, thereby streamlining the workflow and improving the quality of data representation.</h3>

          <h2 class="pro-title cntr-txt">Least Different Group Matching Analysis & Visualization</h2>
          <div>
            <h3 class="pro-description">Problem:</h3>
            <h3 class="pro-description indented">In experiments involving pair-housed subjects, the 
              challenge lies in assigning them to two groups (control vs treatment) with 
              minimal initial differences between groups. This ensures that any biases from 
              previous conditions do not influence the outcomes of subsequent experiments. 
              Moreover, it's crucial to maintain cage mates within the same group to prevent 
              potential cross-group effects—if one subject experiences stress due to its 
              group's treatment, it could impact the results of its paired partner in future 
              tests. Compounding this challenge is the need to identify the two groups that 
              exhibit the absolute least differences, a task that could potentially involve 
              analyzing and comparing hundreds, if not thousands, of group assignment 
              possibilities. Such extensive analysis would be impractical for a human to 
              perform manually. 
            <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
            <h3 class="pro-description indented"> 
              A PySimpleGUI desktop application was developed to analyze individual 
              data from cage mate pairs stored in an Excel file while preserving 
              their pairing. The application systematically evaluates every possible 
              combination of group assignments to identify the combination where the 
              data points exhibit the least overall difference. This analysis 
              includes calculating and recording various metrics in an Excel 
              output file, such as: 
              <ol>
                <li class="rh-list">All possible group combinations considered</li>
                <li class="rh-list">The means of all possible group combinations</li>
                <li class="rh-list">The absolute differences between data points 
                                    across all group combinations</li>
                <li class="rh-list">The specific group assignments resulting in 
                                    the smallest mean difference between groups</li>
              </ol>
              A graphical representation using Matplotlib, 
              where two lines depict the data points of the least 
              different group assignments is also displayed. While maintaining 
              adherence to cage mate pairing, these lines are plotted to visually 
              illustrate the minimal distance between data points.
              The application’s output provides a comprehensive overview of the 
              analysis steps and results, facilitating informed decision-making 
              for optimal group assignment in experimental setups.</h3>

                <h3 class="pro-description indented">In studying the effects of 
                  exercise using a running wheel, the wheel tracks total revolutions 
                  every minute, with data logged into an Excel worksheet per minute 
                  over a 24-hour cycle creating one sheet per subject for each 
                  24-hour cycle. For many subjects over extended periods, this 
                  generates millions of data points. The analytical challenge 
                  includes counting only valid running bouts (≥3 revolutions per 
                  minute) and distinguishing running behaviors between the light 
                  (inactive) and dark (active) phases of the light cycle. The goal 
                  is to efficiently process and analyze this extensive dataset to 
                  quantify various aspects of running behavior while considering 
                  phase-specific activity patterns, providing meaningful insights

                    miscategorized transactions, leading to inaccuracies. These 
                    inaccuracies can mislead users, affecting their ability to make 
                    informed financial decisions and plan budgets effectively. 
                    A more personalized and precise system that accurately 
                    categorizes spending and tracks detailed spending patterns over 
                    time, provides more reliable data to support financial planning. 
                  <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
                  <h3 class="pro-description indented"> 
                    To address the limitations of basic spending charts, a 
                    Python script was developed to offer a personalized and 
                    accurate view of spending data over time. This script 
                    processes CSV files from bank and credit card statements 
                    using the Pandas library, categorizing and analyzing the 
                    data in detail. It then generates visualizations with 
                    Matplotlib, such as stacked bar graphs, to present monthly 
                    spending across specific categories. This approach provides 
                    clear, detailed insights into financial activity, facilitating 
                    better tracking and analysis of expenditures.</h3>

                  <h3 class="pro-description">Problem:</h3>
                  <h3 class="pro-description indented">In our lab, we quantified 
                    and analyzed the locomotion activity of experimental test 
                    subjects using an activity tracking chamber. This chamber 
                    records the subjects’ movements via infrared beam breaks 
                    and the software outputs comprehensive data in a .txt file 
                    across various categories. However, our analysis requires 
                    only specific portions of this data. Currently, locating, 
                    extracting, and transferring this relevant data into a 
                    formatted Excel spreadsheet for statistical analysis is a 
                    manual, labor-intensive task that consumes significant time 
                    and is prone to errors, especially with large datasets from 
                    multiple subjects over extended experimental periods. 
                  <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
                  <h3 class="pro-description indented"> 
                    To address the inefficiencies in handling locomotion activity 
                    data, a desktop application was developed with a user-friendly 
                    interface that automates the data processing workflow. 
                    The application transforms the raw .txt file into a 
                    standardized format, selectively extracts the relevant data 
                    categories required for analysis, and transfers this data 
                    into a properly formatted Excel spreadsheet. This automation 
                    reduces the processing time from hours to seconds and eliminates 
                    the risk of human errors associated with manual data handling.</h3>
