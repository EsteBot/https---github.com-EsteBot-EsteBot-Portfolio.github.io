        <h3 class="pro-description indented">
          Behavioral neuroscience research depends heavily on accurately quantifying 
          the frequency and duration of specific behaviors. Often, these are single 
          behaviors selected based on their importance in contributing to the 
          understanding of underlying mechanisms, relationships, or phenomena being 
          investigated. Therefore, this behavior needs to be meticulously segmented 
          into individual occurrences. This task often requires the input of 
          multiple observers to ensure unbiased results. Moreover, experiments 
          often involve testing numerous subjects over extended periods, making it 
          essential to have a straightforward and reliable method for robust behavior 
          quantification. To maximize efficiency, it’s ideal that the resulting data 
          is readily available in a format suitable for detailed analysis.

        <h3 class="pro-description indented">
          A Python-based mobile application using the Kivy framework was developed 
          to streamline behavioral data collection for scientific research.

          an Excel document dedicated to storing behavior data. Upon activation, 
          a main button on the app's interface records instances when subjects 
          engage in the targeted behavior.

            Accurate drug dosing is essential in experimental research involving 
            animal subjects, especially in studies that rely on precise drug 
            formulations. Our laboratory frequently trains students new to 
            scientific research and animal models of neurobiology. A significant 
            hurdle they face is converting between units of measurement: animals 
            are weighed in grams, whereas drugs are measured in grams, yet dosing 
            calculations must be expressed in milligrams of drug per kilogram of 
            animal body weight. These unit conversions pose a challenge, often 
            leading to confusion and errors among novice scientists, which can 
            compromise the accuracy and reliability of dosing in experimental 
            protocols. To enhance accessibility and mitigate these challenges, 
            there is a compelling need for a mobile application. Such an 
            application would enable users to perform precise dosing calculations 
            conveniently and promptly anywhere in the laboratory, ensuring 
            consistent and reliable dosing practices. 
          <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            To address challenges associated with unit conversions and 
            calculation errors in drug dosing, a Python-based Kivy application 
            was designed. This application features two distinct calculation 
            functionalities, each accessible through user-friendly tabs, aimed 
            at simplifying drug formulation tasks:</h3>
            <h3 class="indented-list">
              <ol>
                <li>Drug Weight Calculation: Users input the desired milligrams 
                  per kilogram dose and the total volume required for the solution. 
                  The application swiftly computes the precise amount of drug 
                  needed in both grams and milligrams, alongside displaying the 
                  maximum subject gram weight the formulation will support.</li>
                <li>Volume Calculation: This tab allows users to input the 
                  combined weight of animals slated to receive the drug and 
                  the targeted mg/kg dose. The application instantly calculates 
                  the exact quantity of drug in grams and milligrams required 
                  for the dosage, as well as the corresponding required volume 
                  of solution in milliliters.</li>
              </ol>

          <h3 class="pro-description">
            By automating these calculations, the application equips novice 
            scientists with a reliable toolset to execute dosing procedures 
            accurately and efficiently. Its mobile compatibility further 
            ensures accessibility wherever and whenever needed, supporting 
            seamless integration into daily laboratory workflows.

              a distance from their bregma location that is calculated to position 
              an apparatus at a desired location in the brain. These calculations 
              are most often performed in a lab notebook and using a basic 
              calculator. This method introduces the possibility of human error, 
              is slow, might be illegible to other lab members, can be variable in 
              how values are formatted between individuals increasing confusion if 
              referenced by other lab members.</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            A Python Kivy app was created to assist in correct coordinate 
            calculations when performing stereotaxic brain surgery on rodents. 
            The application has three tabs, the tab chosen being based on the 
            number of stereotaxic targets the operator is aiming for. 
            The Unilateral tab is for a single target, the Bilateral tab is 
            for two targets, each equidistant and on either side of the brain, 
            the third tab is useful for two bilateral targets having four 
            calculated targets total. The app takes the initial bregma variables 
            as well as their respective distance variables and performs their 
            calculations to display the color-coded target values to the user. 
            The target values are then simply dialed into the stereotaxic frame. 
            This eliminates hand calculation time as well as human error. 
            The app has several additional fields to facilitate record keeping. 
            These are ‘Subject’, ‘Experiment’, ‘Operator’, ‘Weight’, ‘Region’, 
            ‘Date’, there is also a ‘Reset’ button for the quick start of the next 
            subject or input errors.  The app introduces the capability to export 
            or integrate data seamlessly into lab databases or experimental records. 
            Since the input values are uniformly formatted, color coded and not 
            individually written in different lab notebooks, the records can be 
            accessed and understood by all lab members from anywhere the lab’s 
            file system can be accessed.</h3>

      designed for the recording and preliminary analysis of animal freezing behavior. 
      Animal freezing behavior is a proxy for their fear in response to foot shock, 
      auditory tone, or environmental context. The application has a field for the 
      user to enter a file name for the Excel sheet that will store the recorded and 
      calculated data. Additional fields for the Excel output sheet include 
      Experiment ID, Observer ID, and Subjects 1-4 IDs. A stopwatch style timer is 
      also available to track the progress and duration of the experimental trial. 
      This timer can be used to enter and reset the time for each subsequent 
      experimental trial. Under each Subject ID is a checkbox that is checked 
      indicating the Subject is freezing at that period of observation. 
      The program is set so that the Subjects are observed once every 10sec. 
      So, the output generated is percent time freezing per minute. 
      After each observation, the user presses the ‘Enter 10sec FZ Data’ button 
      to record data for that period and clear the check boxes in preparation

      observation should take place after each observation. Once the experimental trial has concluded 
      and all data is ready to be recorded, there is a ‘Unlock Submit Button’ 
      (created to prevent unintentional submission of data) button that enables 
      the ‘Submit Trial Data’ button that exports all data to the previously 
      created Excel file. Exported behavior measures are also divided into several 
      categories depending on the experimental parameters and is automated through 
      the program so the user can simply open the Excel file created through the 
      application and run the output data through the laboratory’s preferred 
      statistical testing software.</h3>
