                <li>Our laboratory wanted to design a new animal behavioral experiment.
                    However, this required the programming of operant conditioning chambers
                    written in a programming language that I had to learn and master on my own.
                    Overcoming this challenge is when I initially discovered the power of 
                    coding and programming.</li>

                <li>Began learning Python due to its versatile applications in the scientific field.

                </li>
                <li>Realizing Python's ability to automate tasks, I decided to try and solve the problems
                    of tedious data collection and entry that plague most data dependent laboratories.
                    This resulted in the creation of numerous programs that saved countless hours
                    of data aggregation and processing time.
                </li>
                <li>Wanting to share these solutions, presented the next problem of how to empower
                    colleagues so that they too might use these programs for their projects. This is when I began 
                    learning how to construct and design GUI applications. These efforts culminated in the creation of many 
                    standalone executable and sharable data processing files with user interfaces for non-technical
                    lab members.
                </li>
                <li>To further supply solutions for lab members brought me to my next challenge.
                    There are many tasks in the lab that require correct calculations, that are routine, yet
                    prone to error. For example, drug dosing calculations or converting between different
                    chemical solution percents. To solve these problems, I created sharable mobile applications
                    so lab members could solve these on-the-spot right on their phones to ensure speedy calculation accuracy.

            <ul>
                <li>Although automating data collection and calculations saved much time, there
                    is one more step essential to the scientific endeavor, the analysis of the data.
                </li>
                <li>I began learning data analysis and visualization while also making these sharable
                    programs to ensure my colleagues could perform these analyses themselves through
                    user friendly GUI designs.

            <li>I now endeavor to further my data analysis and visualization skills. Learning
                to work with more complicated datasets and further enhance their interpretation
                through beautiful visualizations.
